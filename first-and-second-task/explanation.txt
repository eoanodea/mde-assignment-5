This zip contains the atl code necessary to convert the A2 model to an A3 model.
There are two examples provided of dynamic istances of A2 then converted.
The idea behind the dynamic and static content is that when only one static content
is present then it an individual is produced otherwise an index composed by individuals is.
The conversion works no matter the number of classes.
